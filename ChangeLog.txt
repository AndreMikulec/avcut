v0.5 (2022-04-10)
=================
 It has been a long time since the last release as I have no need for a video
 cutter anymore and my spare time has become quite limited. As I saw this tool
 is still of interest for people, I decided to invest some time again to at
 least keep it usable with newer ffmpeg versions. The necessary changes required
 a little bit more effort than I thought but I managed to get it working again
 and I fixed some bugs on the road, too. However, due to the amount of changes,
 I would not guarantee that there are less bugs in the code now than before. So
 please take extra care when checking the resulting videos.

 * Fixed all deprecation warnings present with ffmpeg 4.3.2 (Ubuntu 21.04)
 * Fixed some bugs
 * Removed libav compatibility code

v0.4
====
 * progress information (Christoph Läubrich)
 * added dockerfile (Christoph Läubrich)
 * various build related fixes (gCurse, billie80)
 * and other small improvements

v0.3
====

 * encoding flags can be loaded from file
 * fixed a bug that occurs if the end of a video is included
